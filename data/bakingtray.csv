AN OVEN TRAY THAT FITS MOST OVENS: Most European domestic ovens have an interior width of 46 cm (Siemens, Bosch, AEG, Electrolux, Samsung, Balay, OK, Teka, Zanker, among others) our oven trays fit perfectly into this type of ovens. If you have any doubts, you can measure the interior width of your oven according to the instructions you will find in the photos.
EUROPEAN PREMIUM QUALITY: This baking sheets are made in an European factory that has many years of experience in creating products for professional cooks and pastry chefs. Made with a manganese aluminum alloy that gives it a mirror-like polished finish. This heavy duty baking tray is both durable and functional.
2mm THICKNESS, UNDEFORMABLE: The thickness of our oven baking tray is the standard one used in the industrial sector, granting that at high temperatures and for long periods of time this product will not deform or damage your food. This differentiates it from conventional trays that have a thickness between 0.8 - 1.5mm.
WHY CHOOSE A PERFORATED BAKING SHEET?: In conjunction with the convection function of your oven, the perforated tray will achieve uniform cooking without needing to turn the food and do it in less time, thanks to the fact that the hot air circulates between the holes, cooking your food evenly on both the top and at the bottom. You will achieve similar results as an air fryer, with your home oven.
100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEED: We are so confident in the quality and functionality of this product that we have decided to offer a 100% refund, within 30 days of purchase, in case you are not completely satisfied with your purchase. Contact our customer service for more information.

✅ COMPLETE BAKING SHEET & COOLING RACK SET is the perfect kitchen duo for people who love to bake, fry, toast, and roast (AND save precious cabinet space!). Get better tasting, faster cooking, and healthier food out of the oven and onto your plate in no time. Then clean up easy with anti-rust, dishwasher safe carbon steel. Set contains one cooling rack and tray.
✅ AIR FRY IN YOUR OWN OVEN the crispiest bacon, chicken, french fries and more - using the convection setting! Elevated cooling rack nests perfectly inside the baking sheet to promote hot air circulation; while releasing oil that otherwise soaks into your food on stovetop. Reduce the fat and don't compromise the crunch.
✅ ROAST with ease! Nest the rack inside the baking sheet to keep your roasting veggies and meats elevated. The 1 inch deep sheet works as a roasting pan to collect natural food juices and drippings to make delicious gravies, stocks, and more.
✅ BAKE oven-fresh ooey, gooey cookies that stick to your sweet tooth - but never the pan! Easy-release non-stick coating gets your still warm and fragile cookies safely off the cookie sheet and onto the cooling rack to finish cooking to your perfect texture and temp.
✅ MORE EFFICIENT COOKING. Dark steel cooks food faster than glass or aluminum cookie sheets by getting hot quicker and retaining heat longer. So you can avoid burnt, charred cookies with better temperature control and even heating (up to 450 degrees!) Extra wide rims make easy handling and oven transfers a breeze - even when the sheet is full of drippings!

CRISPY OUTSIDE, SOFT INSIDE - The baking mould specially designed with small holes in these baguettes ensures that the heat is distributed perfectly during the baking process. The moisture in the dough can escape through the holes - making the baguettes crispy on the outside and stay soft on the inside.
Cleaning friendly – the baguette baking tray can be easily cleaned in the dishwasher. However, in order to prolong its life, we recommend that you clean it with a damp cloth and some detergent especially for frequent use.
