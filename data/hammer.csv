"Staplefords Sledge Hammer - 10lb, 14lb Sledgehammer - with Genuine Hickory Handle 900mm (14)
★★★ FORGED STEEL HEAD ★★★ The reinforced forged steel SledgeHammer head is an alloy of carbon and iron that is compressed under extreme pressure to make a very hard and strong substance - hardened and tempered for durability.  The bonus of forged steel is that the metal becomes stronger than equivalent types that are cast or machined.
★★★ HARDWOOD HICKORY HANDLE ★★★ Harder woods are more resistant to dents and dings than softer woods. This is the main reason why fine furniture, cabinets, and premium trim work are usually made of hardwood. Hardwood simply stands up better to everyday use and abuse.
★★★ HANDLE DESIGN ★★★ The hardwood hickory handle is designed with an oval shape so it can harnesses the downward force of a swing.  Its swinging action is however comparable to the swinging action made while using an axe and is not like a hammer’s action.
★★★ HEAVY DUTY USE ★★★ This is a tool that is not meant for light duty tasks. In fact, its big size and design make it perfect to use for those tasks that require extra force and effort than that produced by a standard hammer.  While you do need to have some strength to use a sledge hammer with full force, it’s mainly the long swinging range and heavy head that increases the resulting force and impact.  Sledge Hammers are perfect to use for demolition work.

"Club Hammer 1250 Grams with 2K fibreglass Handle from WIESEMANN 1893 | Enforce Series | Forged and Induction Hardened Hammer Head | 80546
1250G CLUB HAMMER - high performance hammer with forged hammer head from the ENFORCE series - complies with DIN 6475 and 1041. The precision hammer head has a 18cm² striking surface. The distribution of weight between the hammer head and the 2K fibre handle minimises vibrations and increases safety when using.
HAMMER HEAD - the swaged hammer head is DIN 6475 and 1041 compliant. The sides are coated in black and the head is shiny steel. To ensure safety, the face is hardened according to regulations and tempered with precision edges.
2K FIBRE - this hammer comes with our low vibration fibreglass handle made from two components. The green fibreglass component absorbs shock particularly well and is also much more robust than a wooden handle. The black thermoplastic component fits ergonomically in the hand and has a slip proof surface. The handle is securely attached to the hammer head.
DURABLE - the head is forged from fine-grained carbon steel. Each hammer head is heat-treated and then induction hardened.
WIESEMANN 1893 ENFORCE series - the ENFORCE series includes particularly robust impact and levering tools from WIESEMANN 1893. All the items in the ENFORCE series are designed to provide high impact and leverage force. The choice of particularly strong steel and hardening processes makes these tools suitable for use in industrial settings, at home, or for trade.
