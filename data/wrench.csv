** TEST BEFORE USE ** At 2Nm the click on the handle is very subtle and there will be no audible click. We recommend testing the torque wrench on a higher torque setting before use, to become familiar with how the wrench operates. The wrench does not stop over torquing, it only indicates when the correct torque has been reached. As soon as there is any movement in the handle then the correct torque setting has been reached and the operator should cease applying pressure.
Adjustable Range of 2-24Nm, Including Torques. Suitable For Most Bike Stems, Handlebars, Seats etc.
Essential For Any Workshop or Bicycle Enthusiast, Especially Those With a Carbon Bike.
